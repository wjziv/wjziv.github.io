The only problem is that there are two versions. The short version skips a few steps which improve the rising process. The 5-part long version includes everything for a delicious loaf, but it takes 37 years to read through it all for the action steps.
The first time you make a bread loaf, I recommend you follow along the long-form recipe on the Serious Eats website to find out the &amp;lsquo;right way&amp;rsquo; to execute things like a &amp;lsquo;fold&amp;rsquo; or read up on tips for transferring dough from one bowl to another.</description></item></channel></rss>
