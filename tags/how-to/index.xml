Updates to content will be incorporated into the site via triggered Github Actions.
Requirements Install Git Install Go Install Hugo Getting Started Crack open your IDE of choice and navigate to the parent folder of choice.
Still TODO While I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with the structure of my website for now, there are still changes I&amp;rsquo;d like to approach in the future.</description></item><item><title>VSCode on the Cloud</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200426-vscode-server/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200426-vscode-server/</guid><description>Goal Using Google Cloud Platform, host an instance of VSCode to access via the browser for ~$25-$50/month. More specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting an instance of Code-Server on GCP in a constantly-running VM.
This works as an alternative to the cloud-development environments which may limit the developer in some way:
Number of private repositories Working Hours in a given period Number of projects Repository integration. Requirements This tutorial assumes you have already set up a GCP account and enabled billing.</description></item><item><title>Run VSCode in the Browser</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200107-vscode-browser/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200107-vscode-browser/</guid><description>As a ChromeOS user, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to find that most Linux programs don&amp;rsquo;t run as smoothly as one would hope. If there&amp;rsquo;s a version that runs in the browser, it&amp;rsquo;s likely to be a better experience.
Enter code-server. While its primary intention is to be run on the cloud as a server-based IDE, they provide builds which you can run locally.
Releases: https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases
Move tar file to the linux container.</description></item><item><title>Installing Python on ChromeOS</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200105-python-on-chromeos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200105-python-on-chromeos/</guid><description>The use of each software being installed:
pyenv - install and manage different versions of python
pipenv - manage the different development environments you may need to use in the future. Usecase: you have a project that requires Dependency A v1, and another that required Dep A v2. You can&amp;rsquo;t have both installed onyour device. Use environments. Pipenv makes it easy to use virtual environments and pip together at one time.</description></item><item><title>SFTP Server Setup</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200104-sftp-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200104-sftp-server/</guid><description>Assuming the user has already created a VM with a static IP address open to HTTP/S traffic&amp;hellip;
SSH into the VM which you&amp;rsquo;d like to turn into a SFTP server.
Create a new account which you&amp;rsquo;d like to provide to users to deposit files:
sudo adduser username sudo passwd username Create the sftp directory and limit the user&amp;rsquo;s access and permissions. Change the username appropriately:
sudo mkdir -p /var/sftp/uploads sudo chown root:root /var/sftp sudo chmod 755 /var/sftp sudo chown username:username /var/sftp/uploads Enable client authentication in the ssh config file:</description></item><item><title>GCP VM Setup for Squid Proxy and SFTP</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200103-gcp-vm-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200103-gcp-vm-setup/</guid><description>Assuming the user has already opened a GCP Account and enabled billing&amp;hellip;
The goal of this tutorial is to create a server which will be responsive to external HTTP requests for the purpose of serving external users a FTP server to drop files, or operate as an authenticated proxy.
Open Compute Engine &amp;gt; VM Instances. Createa new Instance. (NOTE. If you would like to create a template from which more instances can be made, perform the following steps from Instance Templates.</description></item><item><title>Squid Proxy Server Setup</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200103-squid-proxy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200103-squid-proxy/</guid><description>These instructions assume you have successfully completed the following:
Opened a GCP account. Set up a VM with a static IP address and open HTTP/HTTPS ports. The goal of these instrctions is to create a functional proxy VM on GCP.
Setting up the port rules:
With you VM already created and tagged correctly, navigate to VPC Network &amp;gt; Firewall Rules. Here, a number of networking rules have been created.</description></item></channel></rss>
