More specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting an instance of Code-Server on GCP in a constantly-running VM.
This works as an alternative to the cloud-development environments which may limit the developer in some way:
Number of private repositories Working Hours in a given period Number of projects Repository integration. Requirements This tutorial assumes you have already set up a GCP account and enabled billing.</description></item><item><title>Run VSCode in the Browser</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200107-vscode-browser/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200107-vscode-browser/</guid><description>As a ChromeOS user, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to find that most Linux programs don&amp;rsquo;t run as smoothly as one would hope. If there&amp;rsquo;s a version that runs in the browser, it&amp;rsquo;s likely to be a better experience.
Enter code-server. While its primary intention is to be run on the cloud as a server-based IDE, they provide builds which you can run locally.
