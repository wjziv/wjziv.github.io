## I'm Walter.
A programmer, hobbyist researcher, and sometimes I bake stuff.

While also functioning as an online resume, this is where I keep references as a convenience to myself and others when I find the same questions I've asked pop up elsewhere. This includes some dope recipes I've come across; I'll cite wherever I can.

I graduated from RPI in 2016 with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Philosophy. Now I spend most of my time working on/researching backend systems.

My experience in development leans heavily on backend engineering and cloud-hosted solutions. My employer <a href="http://alchemyworx.com/" target="_blank">Alchemy Worx</a> is currently in the process of migrating local services to GCP. 

The opinions shared on this website are entirely my own and not that of my employer.
