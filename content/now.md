## Personal

### Introspective
I'm ever so close to finding my WFH grove. My office is *furnished* and beautiful. My cat is purring and finding his favorite spots in the house. I've identified a few things which fulfill and scratch my itch to 'do a productive, satisfying thing' outside of work.

### Activity
I've turned my active attention to improving organization for my work alongside my personal life. Jira for work and a terrible combo of [Keep](http://keep.google.com/)|GCal|Chicken scratch paper notes have been holding my focus together for 4 years. 

I've managed to create for myself a solid system for Bookmarking and saving links in a meaningful way.

Next up is identifying and trying a bunch of different Project Management Softwares out there; it feels like a proper Herculean task. But the high-striving goal of visualizing "what has to be done" is ever-so enticing1

## Work
We're fleshing out some cool internal, stand-alone tools which are operating at high levels. We've build a solid foundation, and sight of the future is getting clearer and clearer!
