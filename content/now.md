## Personal

### Introspective
I've become much more comfortable with the WFH groove I've found for myself. I've proposed to my beautifully capable girlfriend (now fiance). And I've re-watched nearly the entirety of [Chuck](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/).

Things are looking up, and I'm looking forward to focusing this energy in all the right areas.

### Activity
Once again, I feel comfortable with how things are going!
My self-organization is pointed at a small group of applications I've used previoously, along with a new one (Shout out to [Fullscreen For Google Tasks](https://fullscreen-for-googletasks.com/)!).

Up next is selling my house, saving up for the next one, and preparing for the wedding party of the century!

## Work
I'm learning new technologies in front-end development; I'm expanding my own experience within the cloud ecosystem; and I'm working closely with Google representatives to ensure my usage of the platform is what it should and could be.
