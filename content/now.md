[What is a Now Page?][nownownow]

## Personal
After talking with my sister [Tori](https://www.victoriaakman.com/), I've been reinspired to tackle the project of fixing my personal website. My primary goal here is to make it easier for myself to post new content on a self-hosted/created site.

I'm also considering getting my hands dirty in making sourdough. I haven't done any homework on the topic of starters, though.

My time outside of work has otherwise been focused on algorithmic trading strategies. I've been trying to make an effort to find personal websites where relatively unknown (to me) [traders](http://theminimaltrader.com/automated-trading/) share their findings and experiences.

## Work
I've completely overhauled the underlying reporting structure at Alchemy Worx, and I'm in the middle of ensuring backwards compatibility with previous work.
