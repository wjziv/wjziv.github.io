## Experience

### [Alchemy Worx][alchemyworx]
> *Tech Lead | Cloud/Backend Engineer*, October 2019 - Present

I wore many hats at this medium-sized start-up! After **encouraging the CEO** to pursue modern techniques in data collection and processing, **I lead a small development team** in several disciplines. Expanding on my previous work at SellUP (below), I outlined the **cloud architecture** for wide-scale **ETL pipelines** from our data partners, organized the **serverless** mechanisms & **CI/CD** on **Google Cloud Platform**, and spearheaded the creation of a **custom CRM platform** on top of the existing open-source Odoo project with **integrations** to our other internal tools.

### [Alchemy Worx (formerly SellUP))][alchemyworx]
> *Data Analyst*, January 2019 - October 2019

I optimized emailing schemes and strategies by **collaboratively** planning and interpreting **AB testing** results from email audience segmentation tests. I **accelerated the turn-around time** on client-facing reports by automating much of the routine analytical work with **Pandas** and scripts which **interacted with our partner APIs**. The effect was a manual process which took a coworker 4 hours shrunk to a 1 hour task. Client experience was further improved with **dynamic dashboards** and small, custom web services.

### Freelance Developer
> *Data-Journalist*, July 2018 - Present

I leaned on **Python** as my primary language of choice for analysis and automation to create automatically updating **analytical dashboards** for online publications like The Pudding. Story pitch prototypes were visualized and produced using **D3.js** and **Pandas**. Further tooling to get jobs done included data mining techniques in **web-scraping with BeautifulSoup** and custom-tuned **OCR through Tensorflow**.

### [Agilex Fragrances][agilex]
> *Perfume Technician | Perfumer-In-Training*, August 2016 - January 2019

I supported technical analysis on perfume to reverse engineer fragrances. I produced, groomed, and **maintained datasets** for in-house usage and created custom macros in a **proprietary scripting language** to automate analytical techniques for **quicker project turn-around**.
