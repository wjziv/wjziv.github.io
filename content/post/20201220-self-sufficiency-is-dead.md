I remember learning about the term [Polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) in the Eighth Grade. Mr. Milligan used it in reference to Ben Franklin's wide range of established knowledge at the time.

The term weasled its way back into my head by way of The Decemberists' [Ben Franklin's Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0UFSglFdQwaZiPKcRIs2mT?autoplay=true) a few years ago.
