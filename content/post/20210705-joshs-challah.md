My sister's husband Josh didn't actually make this bread. It was only with him that I ever made challah for the first time. Proper credit goes to [Beth Ricanati](https://bethricanatimd.com/recipe).

When we first made this recipe, it had the dense, squishy texture one might expect of an open-oven baked bread with little rise-time. I fully intend to return to this recipe with improvements with regard to rise time, baking in a dutch-oven, and weaving to fit inside a small pan.

## Recipe 

{{< expandable label="Ingredients" level="2" >}}
- 2.5 tsp / One packet yeast (Bread Machine is my preferred!)
- ~0.25+ cup sugar
- 1 cup warm (not hot!) water
- 2 eggs (+1 yolk for wash)
- 2 tsp salt
- 0.5 cup oil
- 4+ cups flour
{{< /expandable >}}

Makes 2 small loaves.

### Instructions

1. Mix yeast, sugar & warm water together in small bowl (1); let stand approx. 10 min.  This mixture will start to bubble.
1. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, mix 2 eggs, salt, sugar, oil & 2 c flour together (2). 
1. Add yeast mixture (1) to flour mixture (2).
1. Add approx. 1½ cups of flour to mixture. Dough should start to form a ball, separating from the bowl.
1. Place dough on a floured surface & knead, lifting up with one hand & then the other. Knead at least 5 mins as dough becomes increasingly elastic. If still sticky, add a bit more flour to dough. Knead dough into a ball.
1. Place dough back into oiled bowl, cover & place bowl somewhere warm for 1 – 1½ hours to rise, approx. doubling in volume.
2. Preheat oven to 375º. Remove cover from bowl, place dough on floured surface. Take a small piece of dough (about the size of an egg), double wrap in plastic wrap.
3. Punch out dough one more time.  Cut dough in half, one for each challah.  Then divide each half into 3 equal pieces. Roll out each piece, crimp together at the top and braid into a loaf. Place on a greased (or parchment paper or a silpat liner) baking sheet. Repeat with second ball of dough. May let rise again at this step.
1. Paint each challah with a mixture made of egg yolk plus a little water.
1. Bake approx. 25 – 30 mins, or until bread rises & is golden brown.  Remove, cool.
