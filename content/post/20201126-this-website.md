## Summary
Host a personal website on Github using the Hugo site generator. Updates to content will be incorporated into the site via triggered Github Actions.


## Requirements
- [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)


## Getting Started
Crack open your IDE of choice and navigate to the parent folder of choice.


## Still TODO
While I'm pleased with the structure of my website for now, there are still changes I'd like to approach in the future. Some may require monkeywrenching hardcoded details from the Cupper Hugo Theme; I'll link to update/change notes here as new tasks completed.

- Include social media tags in the menu bar.
- Move the darkmode toggle to the side menu with a smaller button.
- Search bar on the Resources page.
- Change the `post` page to `posts`.
- Add dates/descriptions to the post list.
- Soften dark mode's color shift.
- Remove Disqus support entirely.
- Include Hypothes.is support.
