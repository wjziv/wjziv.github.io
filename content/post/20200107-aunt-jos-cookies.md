Everybody has an aunt with their own way of making *those* Italian Christmas cookies.

And I've discovered that my Aunt Jo has at some point shifted to a second recipe. The time of transition is unknown, and which is the old/new version is a mystery; I simply refuse to ask, because I haven't noticed the difference over time, and I can only dream that I grew on on a "better cookie", whicher it may be.

This calls for a taste-test bake off! I'll keep both recipes available here while I determine which is the better cookie and reward a crown sometime after Christmas this year.

### Comments
- Yield is not provided; last time I made these, I fed 35 people and only still froze half the dough.
- The intention is for these to "look" like the Ricotta cookies, but there is no ricotta?
- Crisco as a "substitute" for Ricotta introduces ~5x the calories per gram, and it's all fat-based.
- Question: While shortening is not a drying agent, does it moisturize as well as ricotta?
- The recommendation for S-cookies as a shape implies this should be a dry cookie, but the control for browning implies they ought to be under-baked. What exactly is this cookie trying to be?!

### Comments
- There's so much freedom and wiggle room to this recipe, I don't know if my creation will accurately represent Jo's masterpiece.
- This recipe appears to be much more moist, on paper.
