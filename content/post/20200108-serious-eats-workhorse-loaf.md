[Serious Eats][seriouseats] has a spectacular recipe for a hand-made loaf of whitebread. The only problem is that there are two versions. The [short version][shortrecipe] skips a few steps which improve the rising process. The 5-part [long version][longrecipe] includes everything for a delicious loaf, but it takes 37 years to read through it all for the action steps.

The first time you make a bread loaf, I recommend you follow along the long-form recipe on the Serious Eats website to find out the 'right way' to execute things like a 'fold' or read up on tips for transferring dough from one bowl to another.

As a solution to returning to the recipe later, I've summarized it using my preferred tools/ingredients. Everything outlined and linked to below are items I actively use everytime I bake bread.

## Recipe
Get ready; this is going to take ~6 hours. You're going to spend the whole day in/near the kitchen and get your clothes all kinds of flour-y.

For one ~10" wide loaf of bread:

1. Incorporate flour and water together in the mixer on low-medium. (NO SALT OR YEAST).

    It'll be sloppy and wet. Make sure there are no dry pockets of flour.
1. Cover mixing bown with cloth; leave to sit for 30 minutes. (Autolyse)
1. Add salt and yeast in the mixer on low-medium.
1. Once combined, increase speed to medium and let it run for ~5 minutes. (Knead)

    I check in when I hear the mixture just start thwap and slap against the bowl. Serious Eats describes the desired texture as muscle-fiber-y. If the texture isn't quite there, keep mixing.

1. Lightly oil the medium-large bowl. Transfer dough in with greased spatula or hands. Try to 'roll' the dough out as opposed to ripping it out in peices.
1. Cover the bowl with a cloth; leave to sit on the counter for 30 minutes. (Begin bulk fermentation)

    This is best done in a room 70-75℉. No biggie if your house is a cool 65℉ or whatever.
1. Fold the dough within the bowl over itself, 4x.
1. Cover the bowl with a cloth; leave to sit on the counter for 30 minutes.
1. Fold the dough within the bowl over itself, 4x.
1. Cover the bowl with a cloth; leave to sit on the counter for 60 minutes.

    After 60 minutes, poke the dough and guage how much air is inside. IF it's dense and heavy, wait and try again in ~15 minutes. If it's puffy and full of air, it's ready to move on!
1. Flour countertop; fold the dough over itself and form into ball.
1. Cover loaf with a cloth; leave to sit on the counter for 30 minutes.
1. Flour the proofing basket + linen; fold the dough over itself; place ball into proofing basket.
1. Cover basket with cloth; leave to sit in the fridge for 60-90 minutes; with the dutch oven inside, preheat your oven/range to 500℉.

    We're looking for the loaf to increase in volume by an additional 50%. (Doubling in size is a sign of potential over-proofing!) The dough should feel like a delicate drum. As a final test, give the dough a poke; if your imprint stays for a second and slowly pops back out, it's ready to move on. If not, wait another 15 minutes and try again.
1. Get the heated dutch oven and open it up; flip the dough into it; score the top with two parallel lines for expansion room; spritz with a healthy dose of water; close the dutch oven; return to oven/range.
1. Bake for 15 minutes.
1. Take out the dutch oven; lift the top to vent out steam; place the top back; return the covered bread to the oven/range.
1. Reduce temperature to 450℉; continue to bake for 15 minutes.
1. Take out the dutch oven; remove the lid to the dutch oven; return the uncovered bread to the oven/range.
1. Continue to bake for 15-20 minutes.
   
   If possible stack the dutch oven such that the lid is a platform for the lower cap inside your oven/range. This will keep the bottom of your bread farther away from the heat source in your oven/range, thus protecting the bottom crust from excessive cooking.

**And that's it!** Let your loaf cool; the crust will be *hot* and possibly as hard as a rock. Once it's cooled, the crust will be softer and a little flakey. Enjoy!

Thank you Serious Eats for helping me through *my* first loaf. If you haven't done so, I encourage you to read through the [long form of the recipe][longrecipe] to learn about bread making with the perfect amount of scientific depth!
