# I'm Walter.
While also functioning as an online resume, this is where I keep notes and instructions as a convenience to myself and others when I find myself sharing the same instructions or looking up the same question more than a handful of times. This includes some dope recipes I've come across; I'll cite wherever I can.

I graduated from RPI in 2016 with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Philosophy. Now I spend most of my time working on backend systems.

My experience in development leans heavily on backend engineering and cloud-hosted solutions. My employer, [Alchemy Worx][alchemyworx] is in the process of expanding our cloud-based services. Definitely [contact me][emailme] if you have interesting resources to share!

The opinions shared on this website are entirely my own and not that of my employer.
