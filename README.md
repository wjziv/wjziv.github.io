# WJZIV Website

[My website!](https://wjziv.com/)

Used as a blog, public note-taking space, and online resume.
The static website is served from the `static` branch, leaving the `master` branch for dynamic code updates.

## TODO:
- Search bar on the Resources page.
- Change the `post` page to `posts`.
- Soften dark mode's color shift.
- Force page length to occupy the whole screen length.
- Personalize font.
- Remove click-box.
- Mod code-text CSS to include a highlight.
- Default darkmode.
- Potentially change URL to 'walter.ski'
- Add pdf version of resume (Parse attached markdown + modify header)
