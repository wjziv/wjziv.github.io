More specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting an instance of Code-Server on GCP in a constantly-running VM.
This works as an alternative to the cloud-development environments which may limit the developer in some way:
Number of private repositories Working Hours in a given period Number of projects Repository integration. Requirements This tutorial assumes you have already set up a GCP account and enabled billing.</description></item><item><title>Serious Eats' Workhorse Loaf</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200108-serious-eats-workhorse-loaf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200108-serious-eats-workhorse-loaf/</guid><description>Serious Eats has a great recipe for a hand-made loaf of whitebread, however the proper recipe only comes in a long-form article series; the short form they provide does not spell out the same recipe in my opnion. As such, I&amp;rsquo;ve made my own summary recipe.

Using the MX Atrium API, Javascript, and Python to forward personal financial data in secure conditions, I created a small application to track and categorize my spending. Not only did I manage to put together the project, but I got my finances in order. Next step is putting together a deliverable web app.</description></item><item><title>Run VSCode in the Browser</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200107-vscode-browser/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200107-vscode-browser/</guid><description>As a ChromeOS user, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to find that most Linux programs don&amp;rsquo;t run as smoothly as one would hope. If there&amp;rsquo;s a version that runs in the browser, it&amp;rsquo;s likely to be a better experience.
Enter code-server. While its primary intention is to be run on the cloud as a server-based IDE, they provide builds which you can run locally.
Releases: https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases

pyenv - install and manage different versions of python
pipenv - manage the different development environments you may need to use in the future. Usecase: you have a project that requires Dependency A v1, and another that required Dep A v2. You can&amp;rsquo;t have both installed onyour device. Use environments. Pipenv makes it easy to use virtual environments and pip together at one time.</description></item><item><title>SFTP Server Setup</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200104-sftp-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200104-sftp-server/</guid><description>Assuming the user has already created a VM with a static IP address open to HTTP/S traffic&amp;hellip;
SSH into the VM which you&amp;rsquo;d like to turn into a SFTP server.
Create a new account which you&amp;rsquo;d like to provide to users to deposit files:
sudo adduser username sudo passwd username Create the sftp directory and limit the user&amp;rsquo;s access and permissions. Change the username appropriately:
sudo mkdir -p /var/sftp/uploads sudo chown root:root /var/sftp sudo chmod 755 /var/sftp sudo chown username:username /var/sftp/uploads Enable client authentication in the ssh config file:</description></item><item><title>GCP VM Setup for Squid Proxy and SFTP</title><link>https://www.wjziv.com/20200103-gcp-vm-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wjziv.com/20200103-gcp-vm-setup/</guid><description>Assuming the user has already opened a GCP Account and enabled billing&amp;hellip;
